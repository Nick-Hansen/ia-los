Line of sight calculator for Star Wars Imperial Assault

Select a map, place your attacker, place a defender, and possibly some defenders.  The map will default to the first line of sight it can display, or none if line of sight is not possible.  If more than one line of sight is available, you can change the Lines of Sight dropdown to view them.

The grid laid over the map and the lines on the grid are not pixel perfect.  The grid is there to help players select spaces, and view results.  The actual calculations are performed in code, not the displayed image.

I hope this project helps Imperial Assault players, speeds up situations where its tough to tell how close a shot is, and enhances the game.

I want to thank Nick (nickv2002) for granting permission to use the map images from the Imperial-Assault-Skirmish-Map-Project GitHub project.

I also want to thank a1bert for granting permission to use the map images from Star Wars: Imperial Assault Vassal Module.
